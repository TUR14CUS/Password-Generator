# Password Generator

## Overview

Welcome to the PyPassword Generator! This Python script allows you to generate strong and random passwords with a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols. You can customize the length and composition of your password based on your security requirements.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TUR14CUS/Password-Generator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Password-Generator
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python password-generator.py
   ```

4. Follow the prompts to specify the number of letters, symbols, and numbers you want in your password.

5. The script will generate and display a randomized password for you.

## Customization

Feel free to modify the character sets used in the script to suit your needs. You can update the `letters`, `numbers`, and `symbols` lists in the script to include or exclude specific characters.

```python
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', ..., 'Z']
numbers = ['0', '1', '2', ..., '9']
symbols = ['!', '#', '$', '%', ..., '+']
```
